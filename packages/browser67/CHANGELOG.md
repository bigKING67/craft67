# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Split browser67 Skill setup/maintenance and auth/native-input guidance into
  linked references; keep readiness verification bound to only the references
  explicitly linked from the Skill entry, and reject missing links or missing
  CAPTCHA/native safety guidance.

## 0.11.4 - 2026-09-05

- Add explicit release updates: read-only latest-release checks, annotated-tag
  pinning, package parity, extension reload verification, scoped Skill sync,
  concurrent-install protection, and retained recovery receipts/backups.

- Label JS reverse live assertion failures by phase and field, and emit bounded
  cleanup results on failure without exposing page or session payloads.

- Align the managed-tab live gate with deferred macOS fullscreen in background
  mode; retain strict fullscreen assertions for explicit foreground acceptance.
- Refresh the release reference-review ledger after inspecting moved external
  JS reverse references; retain reference-only boundaries and no direct imports.

## 0.11.3 - 2026-09-05

- Show CLI version and extension setup build identity, and document tag-pinned
  installation with separate installed and running version verification.

- Apply workspace, task, and Browser Instance filters before managed-tab list
  liveness checks, summaries, groups, and session pointers, including history
  queries, so scoped inspection cannot return another task's managed metadata.
- Preserve background focus when creating or reusing a macOS Agent window:
  defer native Full Screen transitions that activate Chrome until an explicitly
  requested foreground entry, and document that screenshot retries must not
  activate windows without user authorization.
- Keep timed-out debugger attachments isolated until late completion is cleaned
  up, prevent batch cleanup from reentering a pending attach, and report release
  as unverified while recovery is pending. Failed late detach keeps the tab
  quarantined until extension restart; external-owner rejection never detaches
  another debugger. Cover both command and batch recovery with regression tests.

## 0.11.2 - 2026-09-03

- Make mobile viewport and selector screenshots reliable in background hidden
  tabs by replacing RAF-dependent probes with synchronous layout reads, adding
  an atomic CDP layout barrier, and bounding debugger timeout cleanup so
  emulation state and per-tab queues are always released.
- Make the performance smoke resilient to isolated runner filesystem stalls by
  enforcing the unchanged platform run-lifecycle budget against a three-sample
  median; per-event latency and absolute/relative indexed-write gates remain
  intact across every sample.

## 0.11.1 - 2026-09-03

- Separate the screenshot live gate's 25-second operation deadline from its
  30-second RPC envelope so slow viewport cleanup or a structured timeout can
  return without racing an identical client-side deadline.
- Stabilize the Windows performance smoke gate with a platform-specific
  run-lifecycle I/O budget while preserving the stricter macOS/Linux threshold
  and the existing latency, total-write, and relative-filesystem checks.
- Update the transitive `fast-uri` dependency to `3.1.7` so CI and local
  installs include the upstream fixes for the newly disclosed high-severity
  URL canonicalization and SSRF advisories.
- Make the runtime permission audit explicitly skip unsupported POSIX mode
  enforcement on Windows instead of reporting meaningless mode mismatches or
  attempting to emulate ACL changes with `chmod`.

## 0.11.0 - 2026-09-03

- Make responsive screenshots atomic across viewport, selector, clip, and
  bounded full-page targets on TMWD and explicit remote CDP. Each temporary
  viewport override now stays on one debugger attachment through
  set/probe/capture/clear, verifies both page metrics and PNG dimensions, and
  rejects unsupported persistent overrides.
- Bound browser, console, native-input, TMWD, and CDP execution with one
  end-to-end operation deadline while retaining the exact failed phase and
  safety error identity.
- Harden browser67 runtime storage with process umask `077`, owner-only
  directories and files, atomic private writers, permission auditing, stale-run
  terminalization, and narrowly guarded empty-group pruning.
- Canonicalize Browser Instance and tab identities across page context,
  managed-tab registry, reuse, and finalization, and publish the compatible
  `managed-tabs-v9` capability contract.
- Extend the Agent integration doctor to compare browser67 and js-reverse MCP
  tool schemas with Codex approval policy. The audit accepts either an explicit
  server default or complete per-tool coverage, while failing closed on missing,
  invalid, duplicate, or stale tool-policy entries.
- Align Pi integration and release-governance guidance with Pi-67's explicit
  external-repository lifecycle. Maintained Pi-67 installs now use
  `pi-67 external install/update/doctor browser67` and verify the external
  checkout revision instead of editing `settings.json` as a static package
  pin; direct upstream Pi users may still pin a browser67 tag or commit.

## 0.10.0 - 2026-09-01

- Harden managed-browser isolation and bounded runtime ownership: fail closed
  when agent-created work requests the user's current window, cap each task
  scope at eight open unkept tabs, keep managed listings summary-only by
  default, terminalize scoped unfinished runs during finalization, serialize
  per-tab Debugger access, and add a privacy-safe rotating tool journal that
  excludes URLs, scripts, page content, form inputs, cookies, and credentials.
- Enforce screenshot `max_pixels` against the predicted final PNG bitmap after
  device pixel ratio and capture scale for viewport, clip, selector, and
  full-page targets. Captures also verify the decoded PNG dimensions before
  writing an artifact, return predicted and actual bitmap metrics, and fail
  closed with `INVALID_ARGUMENT` instead of silently emitting an oversized
  HiDPI image.
- Fix real local-file upload through the TMWD debugger batch by resolving the
  actual `DOM.getDocument` / `DOM.querySelector` result shape. Rely on
  `DOM.setFileInputFiles` for the native `input` / `change` events instead of
  dispatching duplicates, and add a real-browser gate for ordered multi-file
  input, ordinary single-file input, exact event counts, and temporary cleanup.
- Add `browser_console_ops.observe` for non-persistent observation of console
  API calls, uncaught runtime exceptions, and optional Log-domain entries on
  an exact browser67-managed tab. Duration, entry count, and serialized
  console-entry characters are hard-bounded; external debugger ownership and
  unverified debugger release fail closed, and listeners plus the acquired
  debugger lease are released before success.

## 0.9.0 - 2026-08-31

- Prevent live/release verification from leaving a browser67-created Agent
  window that Chrome can later surface as an ordinary New Tab window. Scoped
  finalizers may request exact empty-window retirement; the extension now keeps
  a bounded Browser Profile startup-epoch ownership tombstone when the exact
  anchor disappears or is replaced in place while retaining its tab ID. The
  epoch survives extension reloads and rotates at the next browser startup. The
  extension automatically retires the window only when Chrome substitutes a
  sole internal New Tab page, and reports ownership-record removal as part of
  the terminal receipt. Identity/epoch mismatches, unowned New Tab windows, and
  any window containing user content remain untouched.
- Bound the live-contract child process with a 60-second default supervisor
  deadline and an explicit `live_timeout` result. MCP contract shutdown now
  installs its close listener before signaling the child and has a hard settle
  deadline, eliminating an intermittent unbounded wait during cold macOS Agent
  Window presentation or cleanup.
- Make explicit foreground work activate the exact browser67-owned native macOS
  Full Screen Space while retaining Chrome/Edge browser chrome, fail closed on
  process/window identity mismatch, and require live `visibilityState` plus RAF
  progress evidence without changing ordinary user windows.
- Scope JS-reverse hook, evidence, and task state by workspace/task with bounded
  retention and successful-finalize cleanup; close every public tool input
  schema, keep artifacts in the owning task scope, and add cross-workspace and
  expiry regressions.
- Validate layered browser governance through the thin global `AGENTS.md`
  pointer, detailed browser rule, active Skill, and live Agent doctor; recognize
  successful browser67 lifecycle receipts with `page:null` only when exact
  `data.ready=true` evidence is present.
- Stabilize the indexed-run performance gate with repeated measurements and a
  same-filesystem control while retaining the absolute and total runtime
  budgets.
- Document Agent Window ownership, retirement, macOS Full Screen visibility,
  JS-reverse state boundaries, and release/upgrade verification as explicit
  operator contracts.
- Review `zhaoxuya520/reverse-skill` through `71acc8e`; confirm its seven-commit
  delta is limited to README star-history/sponsor presentation and one sponsor
  image, retain `direct_import_allowed=false`, and import no external artifact.

## 0.8.0 - 2026-08-30

- Present the browser67-owned Agent Window with native platform behavior: enter
  a macOS Full Screen Space while retaining Chrome tabs, address bar,
  extensions, and bookmarks, and maximize the ordinary Chrome window on
  Windows.
- Bind Agent Window presentation to the exact browser67 anchor and window,
  re-verify that identity after a native transition, and leave ordinary user
  Chrome windows unchanged.
- Review GenericAgent remote main through `efb3bc6`, confirm that its compiled
  React Desktop 2.0 v0.2.1 update changes only `.github` and `frontends` while
  preserving all six `assets/tmwd_cdp_bridge` blob hashes, and retain the
  manual-merge extension decision and historical byte lock without syncing.

## 0.7.0 - 2026-08-30

- Make managed browser work non-exclusive by default: create/reuse new
  browser67 and JS-reverse pages in a same-Profile dedicated non-focused Agent
  window with `background_preferred` focus policy and `active:false`; retain an
  explicit current-window compatibility mode and intentional foreground mode.
- Add bounded managed-tab focus leases for CAPTCHA, native input, and real
  paste, with guarded restoration that yields to user tab/window changes,
  external-app focus changes, missing targets, foreground drift, expiry, and
  extension service-worker recovery. Serialize concurrent lease acquisition,
  live-validate dedicated-tab window ownership, quarantine tabs the user moved
  out of the Agent window without moving them back, and propagate structured
  focus errors across extension, Hub, WebSocket, HTTP Link, and MCP wrappers.
- Serialize extension tab-inventory updates to remove create/update snapshot
  races, add deterministic focus/window safety contracts, and make real
  browser and JS-reverse live gates use isolated background managed fixtures
  while preserving pre-existing active tabs and finalizing all temporary pages.
- Treat the effective transport as managed-lifecycle authority: when an
  explicitly permitted `tmwd_mode:auto` call falls back to controlled CDP,
  preserve `isolated_target` ownership across reuse, liveness, and finalization
  instead of filtering the page as a dedicated-window tab or refusing cleanup.
- Bind CAPTCHA/native physical proof artifacts to a normalized
  `physical-input-v1` behavior-source digest, reject missing or source-mismatched
  historical proofs even when their expiry remains valid, and expose the
  comparison through audit, plan, status, template, and record workflows.
- Review GenericAgent remote main through `7ad2162`, confirm that the intervening
  docs-only PC device-link SOP does not touch `assets/tmwd_cdp_bridge`, record
  the local window/focus overlay files in `UPSTREAM.review.json`, and retain the
  existing manual-merge extension decision and historical byte lock.

## 0.6.0 - 2026-08-27

- Make Browser Instance selection and managed-tab finalization fail closed:
  require an explicit instance when multiple Profiles are active, keep cleanup
  on the resolved instance, require `confirm_all_browser_instances:true` for
  deliberate cross-instance finalization, and reject contradictory selectors.
- Expose the resolved Browser Instance scope in finalizer and delivery summaries;
  strengthen Agent integration readiness with instance-routing anchors and live
  extension version, build, and active-instance evidence; retain valid
  per-instance extension identity when multiple matching bridges are connected.
- Add executable multi-instance lifecycle, relay, live-doctor, and Agent-doctor
  regressions, and synchronize the project guidance and active browser67 Skill
  with the fail-closed routing contract.

## 0.5.0 - 2026-08-27

- Make the background-job contract wait for both execution terminal status and
  job-owned Run terminalization, closing a coverage-visible persistence race;
  preserve full error stacks from the browser MCP contract runner.
- Make verification subprocess execution fail closed on Windows: resolve npm
  through its lifecycle CLI or an explicit command shell, preserve positive
  child exit codes, and map missing status, spawn errors, or signals to a
  diagnostic non-zero result so GitHub Actions cannot report a false green.
- Treat POSIX mode bits as unavailable on Windows when validating login profile
  files, avoiding false insecure-permission warnings from synthetic `stat.mode`
  values while retaining strict `0600` checks on POSIX hosts.
- Normalize extension background source line endings before applying overlay
  transforms so Windows CRLF checkouts produce the same generated bridge as LF
  checkouts.
- Make the upstream-audit final-newline fixture deterministic across platforms
  by removing an entire CRLF terminator instead of leaving a bare carriage
  return on Windows.
- Pin upstream-audit fixture extension files to byte-preserving Git attributes
  so review-ledger hashes survive Windows checkout conversion unchanged.
- Separate extension content identity from build revision, revision source, and
  dirty-checkout provenance so an otherwise identical canonical bundle does not
  trigger setup or reload, while actual source-digest, version, protocol, or
  non-canonical identity drift remains fail-closed. Keep browser transport
  health target metadata private by default, and add an explicit
  privacy-preserving summary mode for JS-reverse page health.
- Add privacy-preserving global Run and Job inspection with status, schema-age,
  ownership, and optional storage aggregates. Auto-terminalize implicitly owned
  screenshot and background-Job Runs, preserve caller-owned Run lifecycle, and
  expose whether a caller must finish the Run explicitly. Route extension
  network observation commands through the native per-instance tab id while
  retaining composite Browser Instance session identity, and return new popup
  targets with both native tab ids and collision-free composite session keys.
- Rebuild the GitHub README as a bounded public landing page, move runtime
  operations and the complete verification inventory into focused docs, and add
  an executable README structure/link/provenance contract to the check tier.
- Restore JS reverse canonical-doc/Skill parity for explicit Browser Instance
  routing and fail-closed ambiguous or unavailable instance behavior.
- Review GenericAgent remote main through `f06d550`, decline its WebSocket-only
  badge/status changes because browser67 owns a transport-aware managed overlay,
  keep the extension byte lock unchanged, refresh the review ledger hashes, and
  make the default extension check compare that reviewed snapshot instead of a
  mutable sibling checkout. Lock verification now hashes its declared Git commit
  instead of requiring the sibling checkout HEAD to equal the historical pin.
- Add the upstream GenericAgent copyright and complete MIT license text to the
  third-party notices, with a public acknowledgement and provenance links at the
  end of the README.
- Refresh transitive lockfile resolutions for `fast-uri`, `nanoid`, and
  `postcss` to versions that clear the current npm security advisories.
- Review the force-rewritten `zhaoxuya520/reverse-skill` reference through
  `289c24b`, retain it as reference-only, and record that its new broad router,
  evidence, and JS side-path material does not require browser67 promotion.
- Retire the `tmwd-browser-mcp` Skill from canonical source, Pi package exports,
  active-skill synchronization, installed-Agent doctor checks, and release
  contracts. Keep only the old CLI/runtime-home/launchd identifiers required to
  migrate or clean up existing installations.
- Keep temporary TMWD viewport emulation, page verification, PNG capture, and
  cleanup in one debugger batch so mobile screenshots cannot lose the
  session-scoped device metrics between bridge requests.
- Add canonical `agents/openai.yaml` metadata to the browser67 Skill, refresh
  the JS reverse descriptor to invoke `$js-reverse`, and lock descriptor parity
  and package inclusion with executable contracts.
- Add a deterministic extension build identity containing the package and
  manifest version, Git revision and dirty state, generated source digest, and
  protocol revision; report it from both `ext_ready` and `tabs_update`.
- Add Hub runtime-info probes over WebSocket and HTTP Link, retain the connected
  extension identity, and require the live identity to match a fresh build from
  the current source before the TMWD doctor reports ready.
- Report active-home and project-local installed identity candidates in the
  live doctor so a stale Chrome-loaded unpacked extension path is observable
  instead of being mistaken for a successful setup or reload.
- Run the browser live contract in a scoped browser67-owned managed fixture tab,
  finalize it before reporting success, and include the contract in the
  verification manifest's live and verify tiers without operating on user tabs.
- Refresh the GenericAgent review ledger through `41e1fce` after manual commit
  comparisons confirmed that `4086d5c..41e1fce` does not touch
  `assets/tmwd_cdp_bridge`, retain the audited browser67 extension fork, make
  `extension:check` distinguish reviewed divergence from strict byte alignment,
  bind that decision to reviewed per-file SHA-256 values, and refuse extension
  synchronization unless review policy or an explicit post-review force flag
  allows mutation.

## 0.4.0 - 2026-07-23

- Add top-level confirmed page context to `browser67.tool-outcome.v3`, including
  page title, redacted URL, tab id, and managed/adopted policy state.
- Add `full`/`compact` output mode to all 17 `tmwd_browser` tools while keeping
  content-scope parameters independent; compact repeated session/transport
  diagnostics and add deterministic response-size/serialization benchmarks.
- Make browser MCP composition own session, WebSocket, transport-health,
  scheduler, snapshot, download, network-observation, run, job, and adoption
  lifecycle state while retaining explicit compatibility defaults for direct
  imports and legacy contracts.
- Add a `node:test` core runtime suite with an enforced 85% line/function/
  statement and 80% branch coverage floor for bounded stores, scheduling,
  page serialization, and structured batch references.
- Remove 21 root-level compatibility or catch-all modules and move active
  imports to capability-local auth, wrapper, CDP, TMWD, session, tab-workspace,
  schema, evidence, run, native, and runtime-error surfaces; reduce the root
  module budget from 26 to 5. Remove the unused MCP error-result formatter
  instead of retaining another compatibility facade.
- Teach the native dependency doctor to unwrap `browser67.tool-outcome.v3`
  before evaluating supported actions and installer prerequisites, avoiding a
  false not-ready result when the native capability probe is actually ready.
- Pin isolated remote-CDP live checks to the exact fixture target across scan
  and execution, revalidate target ID/URL/title after startup-tab cleanup, and
  fail explicitly on target or URL drift instead of accepting `about:blank`.
- Add an installed Agent integration doctor that separates repository/release
  readiness from machine-local MCP, extension, active-skill, AGENTS route, and
  live-runtime readiness.
- Document and align the external frontend `planned_browser_lifecycle` policy
  and runtime receipt boundary for managed-tab creation, explicit user-tab
  adoption, scoped finalization, and login-state fail-closed behavior.
- Align project/global Agent guidance with v0.3 user-tab adoption and the
  deterministic connected-extension reload path.
- Add a real TMWD hot-path performance gate with cold and p50/p95/p99 budgets
  for extension transport, managed execution, actionable snapshots, and
  selector waits.
- Skip the extension's 200 ms new-tab grace period when execution explicitly
  disables monitoring, including read-only scan, extraction, and wait paths;
  preserve that policy across both Hub WebSocket and HTTP Link relay paths.
- Tighten the real TMWD performance guardrails so the previous fixed 200 ms
  per-execution regression cannot silently return.
- Add a deterministic connected-extension self-reload command so installed
  bridge updates no longer depend on extension-page coordinate clicks.
- Move `native-live-linux` out of the default self-use readiness/release proof
  set while retaining the Linux desktop provider, gate, templates, record
  validation, and explicit on-demand audit path.
- Refresh the two moved JS reverse reference-only ledgers after manual diff
  review; retain browser67 as canonical, record that v0.3 already covers the
  applicable MCP runtime patterns, and promote no external code.

## 0.3.0 - 2026-07-21

- Replace browser tool dispatch with Ajv-validated registries and a shared
  `browser67.tool-outcome.v3` envelope on both browser and JS reverse MCP
  surfaces.
- Add explicit user-tab adoption with expiring capability tokens, renewable
  leases, release-by-default finalization, and separate two-stage adopted-tab
  close confirmation.
- Guard adopted-tab navigation with short-lived one-shot extension
  authorizations; suspend on user/out-of-band navigation, connection changes,
  lease changes, or missing managed policy until a fresh re-adoption.
- Add `browser67.actionable-snapshot.v2`, document-scoped NodeRef operations,
  sensitive-value redaction, cross-origin/closed-shadow limitation metadata,
  bounded marker/snapshot policy, and `browser67.semantic-diff.v2`.
- Add request-lifecycle `network_idle`, retain the old resource-entry heuristic
  as `resource_quiet`, add filtered `dom_stable`, and make main-only scanning a
  single page pass. Raw scripts and structured operations can attach the same
  bounded request observation.
- Isolate ordinary tabs from CSP, dialog, badge, marker, content-bridge, and
  network-observer side effects; generate managed behavior through the
  browser67 extension overlay.
- Add TMWD push-session caching, last-known-good transport routing, bounded
  endpoint backoff, and per-tab execution scheduling.
- Replace linear run/job recovery with atomic run checkpoints, append-only
  group indexes, bounded NDJSON tail reads, active-job indexes, cleanup-time
  compaction, and an explicit runtime-store migration command.
- Remove the `browser_execute_js.code` and `browser_job_ops.code` aliases;
  bridge commands now require strict JSON and TMWD raw execution requires an
  agent-created or explicitly adopted managed tab. Automatic transport routing
  does not treat a CDP fallback as explicit remote-CDP authorization.
- Add Biome, scoped JavaScript type checking, dependency-cycle/boundary gates,
  hot-path performance baselines, and a single executable verification
  manifest with fast/check/CI/live/platform/release tiers.

- Refresh GenericAgent and JS reverse reference review ledgers against current upstream commits while preserving browser67 as the canonical implementation.
- Add strict release-time upstream freshness checks and require non-empty Unreleased notes for commits made after the current package version anchor.
- Add run-backed browser job checkpoints, restart recovery to explicit `interrupted` results, and accurate non-preemptive cancellation metadata.
- Add additive capability flags for durable jobs, debugger availability, and CAPTCHA protocol-solver apply support.
- Add tiered verification commands, a machine-readable verification manifest, and cross-platform deterministic GitHub CI with isolated remote-CDP coverage.
- Add a separate c8 coverage-baseline CI job that uploads a machine-readable summary without imposing an invented initial threshold.
- Add p95/p99 run-event latency observations to the deterministic performance smoke gate.
- Add a default 500-run retention ceiling alongside age and total-size cleanup budgets.
- Add dedicated Linux/Windows GUI native-live proof gates that verify native window geometry plus physical drag/click and automatically record sanitized target-OS proof JSON.
- Harden Windows physical pointer execution with foreground HWND verification, `SendInput`, cursor-position readback, and bounded drag/click telemetry.
- Resolve managed Chrome windows by the active tab title and verify the Win32 foreground HWND before Windows physical CAPTCHA input.

## 0.2.0 - 2026-07-01

- Promote `browser67` as the canonical project/package/CLI/runtime identity.
- Keep `tmwd-browser-mcp` and `tmwd-browser` as explicit compatibility aliases.
- Move the default runtime home to `~/.browser67` while preserving
  `~/.tmwd-browser-mcp` as copy-only migration compatibility.
- Add canonical MCP entrypoints under `src/mcp/browser/` and
  `src/mcp/js-reverse/` while retaining legacy server shims.
- Normalize setup registry output to canonical MCP server paths.
- Add release-readiness governance for version metadata, changelog coverage,
  clean/synced release checks, Pi package pin follow-up, and optional live proof
  boundaries.
- Keep GenericAgent/TMWebDriver provenance explicit through upstream lock and
  review gates.
